# Testing Project - Week 3

#### Antonio, Nafisa, Amy and Rosie

##### Task: 

Your project this week is to build a to-do list tracker. It should allow users to create, complete and delete tasks from a list.

You should have automated tests covering all the main user stories.

We found that working on writing functions based on tests that someone else worked on was hard.

Should we refactor tests after they've been already written?

Struggles:
Rosie and Amy: 
- we had to clone our templates instead of just pasting them in, otherwise the points would delete themselves
- we needed to use event.preventDefault() so the submit button kept refreshing the page and deleting our items when we added points
- we needed to correctly access our text content with value, rather than another option
